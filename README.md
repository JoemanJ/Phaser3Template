# Phaser3Template
A simple Phaser 3 game template, based on the book _Infinite Jumper in Phaser 3 with Modern JavaScript_ from _Ourcade_.

Just the bare minimum:  Phaser being imported from the web, a simple "index.html" file prepared to run a scene template and a "Phaser.ts" file with all Phaser types so that your IDE's intelisense can give you definition on Phaser objects, their properties and methods, Phaser functions and autocompletion for all that.

Basically a quick setup for whatever Phaser project.
